I'm an independent open source software developer from & presently residing in Hamburg, Germany.

Having grown up in a multilingual and -cultural environment, I've cultivated an avid passion for my native Spanish
(Chilean/Andalusian dialect) and German (Northern Germany/Hamburg dialect), as well as English (British English,) at
CEFR level C1 according to personal judgment, and Classical Arabic plus an assortment of dialects at CEFR level A2-B1. As
circumstances would have it, this came to include languages habitually spoken solely by computers within the context of the
fields of systems programming and engineering on predominantly UNIX-like and, to some extent, Windows platforms.

I have a strong interest in the intersection of creativity, spoken languages, oral poetry on one hand and, on the other,
expressiveness and an emphasis on aesthetic qualities in programming and engineering with a view to design and implement
maintainable, composable, and well-documented software, preferentially eschewing abstraction and overly complicated code
poor in breadth of expressive modalities.

In my spare time, I like to occasionally write [short stories and poems](https://www.luciaillanes.de/EN/stories/), draw [comics](https://www.luciaillanes.de/EN/etc/)
depicting the futile absurdities of the human condition and existence in general, translate [Arabic poetry](https://www.luciaillanes.de/EN/arabic_poems/)
(badly,) compose gargantuan walls of text on applied transfeminine endocrinology, take long walks whilst pondering
the phenomenological implications of alphabet soup, offer sacrifices to Enki and Labata IÅ¡tar, [cook](https://www.luciaillanes.de/EN/etc/),
and impose long, drawn-out sentences upon [project README files](https://github.com/lalbornoz/PuTTie/blob/master/PuTTie/README.md)
or [websites](https://www.luciaillanes.de) for reasons left unspecified.

I have participated in and continue to participate in open source projects. Please refer to
[Open source projects involvement](https://www.luciaillanes.de/EN/projects) as well as this GitHub
profile for further information.
